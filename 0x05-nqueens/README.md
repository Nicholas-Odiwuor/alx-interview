# 0x05. N Queens

## Description

The **N Queens problem** is a classic puzzle in computer science and mathematics. The objective is to place `N` chess queens on an `N×N` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project focuses on implementing a **backtracking algorithm** to explore all possible solutions to the problem, using **Python**.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn and apply the following:

- **Backtracking algorithms** – exploring recursive strategies to test all potential solutions and discard invalid paths.
- **Recursion** – using recursive functions for elegant problem-solving.
- **Python lists** – storing and manipulating queen positions effectively.
- **Command-line arguments** – handling user inputs with the `sys` module.

## Requirements

- Language: Python 3.4.3
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Style: PEP 8 (version 1.7.\*)
- All files must:
  - Have `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line
  - End with a new line
  - Be executable

---

## Usage

To run the program, use the following format from the command line:

```bash
./0-nqueens.py N
