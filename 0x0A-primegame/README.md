# 0x0A. Prime Game

## 📘 Project Overview

**Prime Game** is a competitive, turn-based game based on number theory and strategic thinking. Players take turns removing prime numbers and their multiples from a sequence of consecutive integers. The player who cannot make a move loses.

This project challenges you to determine the winner of multiple rounds of the game based on given inputs, requiring efficient algorithms and a good grasp of game theory and prime number operations.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### ✅ Prime Numbers
- A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- Efficient detection of primes is key to solving this problem.

### ⚙️ Sieve of Eratosthenes
- A powerful algorithm to generate all primes up to a given number `n`.
- Crucial for optimizing the prime-checking process.

### 🕹 Game Theory
- Turn-based gameplay with strategic removal of numbers.
- Understanding of winning strategies and optimal plays.

### 💡 Dynamic Programming / Memoization
- Speeds up repeated calculations by storing previously computed results.
- Enhances performance across multiple game rounds.
