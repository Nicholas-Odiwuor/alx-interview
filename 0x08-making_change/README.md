# 0x08. Making Change

## Description
This project addresses the **coin change problem** â€” determining the minimum number of coins needed to reach a given total from a set of denominations. It combines principles from **greedy algorithms**, **dynamic programming**, and **algorithmic complexity** to find optimal and efficient solutions.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **Greedy Algorithms** and when they may or may not work.
- Apply **Dynamic Programming** for problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
- Analyze **algorithmic complexity** to improve performance.
- Improve **problem-solving strategies** using recursive and iterative approaches.
- Enhance proficiency in **Python programming** using lists, comprehensions, and control flow tools.

## Concepts Covered
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Time and Space Complexity
- Problem Decomposition
- Python List Manipulation
