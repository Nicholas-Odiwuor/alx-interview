# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on solving the **Island Perimeter** problem using **Python** and algorithmic techniques. The objective is to calculate the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid where `1` represents land and `0` represents water.

You are required to analyze the structure of the grid and determine the number of edges that form the perimeter of the island. This task will help sharpen your skills in matrix traversal, logical reasoning, and perimeter calculation using conditional statements.

## 🔍 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Deepen your understanding of **2D arrays** and how to traverse them.
- Learn how to use **conditional logic** to analyze grid data.
- Develop **counting techniques** to measure valid island borders.
- Apply algorithmic thinking to decompose and solve grid-based problems.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- Iterating over elements using nested loops.
- Accessing adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

### 🔹 Conditional Logic
- Identifying perimeter-contributing cells.
- Avoiding shared edges within land masses.

### 🔹 Problem-Solving Strategy
- Loop through every cell.
- For each land cell (`1`), check its neighbors.
- Add to the perimeter count based on how many sides are not connected to land.
